# experimental-game-anarchy

Experimental Game Anarchy is a place for people who are interested in the exploration of the game medium. I will simply provide a digital hang out space (todo: discord) and a [knowledge-base](https://github.com/Rahil627/experimental-game-anarchy/wiki), starting with [a simple list of games](https://github.com/Rahil627/experimental-game-anarchy/wiki/list). The rest is up to others.

I believe that that list of games will soon turn into a map that shows the directions games have gone throughout history (todo: experimental game map), thus providing us/anyone a map of highly-likely locations of buried treasure: fruitful areas to explore in the game medium).

For the video game side, it could be an extension of the now defunct Experimental Gameplay Project.., but that's just a narrow subset of video games, let alone games!
