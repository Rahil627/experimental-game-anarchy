### rathewolf's experimental game anarchy
a rad anarchist diy digital space for people with a passion for e x p e r i m e n t a l games. Especially useful for people that aren't fortunate enough to have such a physical community nearby (like me! :) ).

probable traits: *silly*, *playful*, *ridiculous yet serious*, cute, rad, inclusive, leader-less (anarchy), punk (DIY), uses ascii art, enjoys s t r a n g e things, vapor-ware, vapor-wave, mods, Earthbound, Mr. Saturn, Super Mario RPG, child-like, caring, loving.

come 'n hang at [the discord!](https://discord.gg/BsUq9n3)\
or if that's empty, you can read 'n even contribute to [the wiki](https://github.com/Rahil627/experimental-game-anarchy/wiki)\
or if that sucks, maybe you can halp make [the site](https://willowolf.com/ega)??, together!

#### notes
should probably move to github pages, to make a simple experimental game database...  
well, it's also quite cool to just have one giant file and use control+f to find what you want. In this way, none of the data hidden!

todo:  
auto pull from the wiki (rahil627.github.io/experimental-game-anarchy) to push to the site's repo (/docs)?
  - :O the ultimate simple public wiki solution!
