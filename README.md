# experimental-game-anarchy

Experimental Game Anarchy is a place for people that are interested in the exploration of the game medium. I hope for it to provide a digital hang out space (todo: discord), and, a [knowledge-base](https://github.com/Rahil627/experimental-game-anarchy/wiki), starting with [a simple list of games](https://github.com/Rahil627/experimental-game-anarchy/wiki/list), that should soon turn into a map that shows the directions games have gone (history), thus providing us/anyone a map of likely locations of buried treasure (: fruitful places to explore in the game medium).

For the video game side, it could be an extension of the now defunct Experimental Gameplay Project.., but that's just a narrow subset of video games, let alone games!
