# experimental-game-anarchy

come 'n hang out at [the discord!](https://discord.gg/9auBPX)  
if that's empty, you can read 'n contribute to [the wiki](https://github.com/Rahil627/experimental-game-anarchy/wiki)

note to self: remember to open access to edit the wiki (under settings for this repo)

should probably move to github pages, to make a simple experimental game database...

[todo: pull from the wiki (rahil627.github.io/experimental-game-anarchy) to push to the site's repo (/docs)]
