whoa.

come 'n hang out at [the discord!](https://discord.gg/BsUq9n3)\
or if that's empty, you can read 'n contribute to [the wiki](https://github.com/Rahil627/experimental-game-anarchy/wiki)\
or if that sucks, maybe you can halp make [the site](https://ega.rathewolf.com)??, together!

#### notes
this part of the readme serves as a simple version of GitHub's projects 'n issues. Start with those features off.

note to self: remember to open access to edit the wiki (under settings for this repo)

should probably move to github pages, to make a simple experimental game database...  
well, it's also quite cool to just have one giant file and use control+f to find what you want. In this way, none of the data hidden, so that's pretty cool!

[todo: pull from the wiki (rahil627.github.io/experimental-game-anarchy) to push to the site's repo (/docs)]
